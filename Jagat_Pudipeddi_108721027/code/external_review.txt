I stayed in Hilton for two days and I was vey satisfied with it. Despite being very inexpensive, the hotel was of world class. Lake Superior was beautiful and the sunrise over the lake was just spectacular. In addition to many other amenities, the luxurious pools were an added plus. The lush bathrooms and spa center and the luxurious bedroom made my stay worth the $256 that I spent. The staff were very courteous and attentive and the mushroom pizza we were offered on the first day deserves a special mention. They also have this custom of offering exquisite wine to new guests, by which I was very impressed. I travel very often and so far I have been staying in other hotels. Next time I travel to Chicago, I will make sure I stay in this hotel and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Chicago. Thank you for a great stay!
